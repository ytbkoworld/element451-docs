# Insight451 Calculated Fields Repo
The following variables use a "left-join" from element_user + element_applications.  Then, we can compute:  

* [Funnel Stage](#funnel-stage)
* [ActiveTerm](#active-term)
* [Year to Year](#yoy)
* [Engagement Score](#engagement-score)
* [Seed Filters](#seed-filter)


# Funnel Stage 

Computes recruitment funnel from milestones.
